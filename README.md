# FinalSubmission
For our project, we chose to look at YouTube through the lens of a content consumer. We chose this because we both have consumed content on YouTube and wanted to analyze our own watching habits. 
To complete the requirements of this project, we created 10 questions, that when answered, could tell us about our watching habits, interests, and if we follow historical trends that other viewers
have followed. The code that we have created uses 3 tables, Video, Channel, and Viewer, that contain information about the videos we have watched, the channels that created those videos, and ourselves
as viewers. To populate these tables, we have created 3 separate .csv files, one for each table. When the user exports their own data from YouTube, they must insert the data with its corresponding table. 
When the main code is executed, the data from the .csv files in imported into the .sql file and inserted into the tables. After this happens, the code to the answers is executed and the questions are answered.
